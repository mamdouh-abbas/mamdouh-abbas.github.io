First, We assume that you installed `Ruby`, you can know that using :

{% highlight ruby %}
ruby -v
{% endhighlight %}

Then, you need to install `Rails`:

{% highlight ruby %}
gem install rails
{% endhighlight %}

You can use  --no-ri --no-rdoc , for no gems documenation

{% highlight ruby %}
gem install rails --no-ri --no-rdoc
{% endhighlight %}

Also, you can know its version using :

{% highlight ruby %}
rails -v
{% endhighlight %}

Now, you are ready to `Rails`

> - Open a terminal
>
> - Go to the parent folder you want to build you application there.
>
> - Type the following line and press `Enter`.

{% highlight ruby %}
rails new autos
{% endhighlight %}

>
> - This will generate a directory called `autos` which contains the <a href="/2016/03/24/Directory_structure_in_rails">rails application directory structure</a>.
>
> - Change directory to `autos`.

{% highlight ruby %}
cd autos
{% endhighlight %}

>
> - Fire up the `rails server`.


{% highlight ruby %}
rails server 
or 
rails s
{% endhighlight %}

>
> - Then,browse to `localhost:3000`.
> - You will see this page:

<img src="/images/rails_welcome.png" alt="rails welcome page" title="rails welcome page">

Note that you can stop rails server using 

{% highlight ruby %}
ctrl + c
{% endhighlight %}

Also, Note that you don't need to restart rails server every time you make changes to you application as long as you are in development environment.

Now, let's start our `autos` application:

First, we will use scaffolding to create cars controller, model, views, routes, test and database migration file in one line.

 {% highlight ruby %}
rails generate scaffold car model:string year:integer
or
rails g scaffold car model year:integer
{% endhighlight %}

This single line will create:

>
> `car` model
>
> `cars` controller
>
> `cars` views
>
> `cars` routes
>
> `cars` tests
>
> `cars` migration file
>

Then we need to create `cars` database table using :

{% highlight ruby %}
rake db:migrate
{% endhighlight %}

This line will create the `cars` table and its database schema in `db/` folder.

Now, you are ready to browse you application and make `CRUD` operations;

`CRUD` means :

>
> `C` for `Create`
>
> `R` for `Read`
>
> `U` for `Update`
>
> `D` for `Delete`
>

Now, browse to `localhost:3000`, you will see the welcome page for rails application, so browse to `localhost:3000/cars` .
