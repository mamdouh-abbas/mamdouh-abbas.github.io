<h4>Ehost.com Hosting Service review.</h4>

First, In 10/04/2016, My order was 70% discount for three yearsfor one hosting and free domain, Note, at this time, I was an initial registeration.

But, When i check the billing, I found the plan is monthly for 4.19$.

After 15 days in 25/04/2016, I found a new billing invoice as in the next picture, `Ehost.com` made a new price 13.98 for `renew`, the `support` chat man said that.

I told him, You are a good man if you discard my account `now` not `tomorrow` because `Ehost.com` is not trusty.
