   <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ruby:</code> is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto in Japan. According to its creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.
   <img style="width:200px; length:300px; float:right; border:5px blue solid;" src="/images/Yukihiro_Matsumoto.png" /></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Ruby</code> was conceived on February 24, 1993. In a 1999 post to the ruby-talk mailing list, Ruby author <code class="highlighter-rouge">Yukihiro Matsumoto</code> describes some of his early ideas about the language.</p>

<p>The name <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ruby</code> originated during an online chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka on February 24, 1993, before any code had been written for the language. Initially two names were proposed: “Coral” and “Ruby”. Matsumoto chose the latter in a later e-mail to Ishitsuka. Matsumoto later noted a factor in choosing the name “Ruby” – it was the birthstone of one of his colleagues.</p>

<p>The first public release of Ruby 0.95 was announced on Japanese domestic newsgroups on December 21, 1995. Subsequently three more versions of Ruby were released in two days. The release coincided with the launch of the Japanese-language ruby-list mailing list, which was the first mailing list for the new language.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Matsumoto</code> has said that Ruby is designed for programmer productivity and fun, following the principles of good user interface design. At a Google Tech Talk in 2008 Matsumoto further stated, “I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language.”[56] He stresses that systems design needs to emphasize human, rather than computer.</p>

<p>Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, “By doing this, the machine will run fast. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively.</p>

<p>By doing this, the machine will something something something.” They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves.</p>
